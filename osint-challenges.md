<h1>Under Public Scrutiny</h1>

<h2>Problem</h2>
DEADFACE mentioned on Ghost Town that they have a public GitHub repository. See if you can find a flag hidden that belongs to DEADFACE.

Submit the flag as: flag{flag-text}.

<h2>Solution</h2>
On this <a href="https://ghosttown.deadface.io/t/made-a-github-link-for-projects/66">GhostTown Thread</a>, bumpyhassan mentions that the username for the Deadface account is deadf4c3.

After searching this user up on Github, I found the flag on this <a href="https://github.com/deadf4c3/tarrasque">repo</a>.

`flag{yAy_4_puBl1c_g1tHUB_rep0s}`

Note: The name of the repo, tarrasque, opens up the flag for the "Monstrosity" programming challenge.

<h1>Fine Dining</h1>

<h2>Problem</h2>
Turbo Tactical is trying to collect data on DEADFACE members. There was talk in Ghost Town about a member whose father owned a restaurant. If we can figure out where their father's restaurant is located, maybe we can narrow down where the member lives.

Submit the flag as flag{flag-text}.

<h2>Solution</h2>
This <a href="https://ghosttown.deadface.io/t/suggestions-for-places-to-eat/68">GhostTown thread</a> is where the discussion happened. mirveal was the user whose father had the restaurant, and he posted a newspaper clipping of it on the thread with the flag on it and his location (Bishop):

Note: mirveal's father is mentioned to be Kaku Shiwaku.
