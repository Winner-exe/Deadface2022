<h1>Two Dead Boys</h1>

<h2>Problem</h2>
Good evening, this is a NEWSFLASH from Quick News Network (QNN)... I'm Crime News Reporter Frank Viginere.

Ladies and gentleman skinny and scout I'll tell you a tale I know nothing about The admission is free so pay at the door Now pull out a chair and sit on the floor

On one bright day in the middle of the night Two dead boys got up to fight Back to back they faced each other Drew their swords and shot each other

The blind man came to see fair play The mute man came to shout hooray The deaf policeman heard the noise And came to stop those two dead boys

He lived on the corner in the middle of the block In a two story house on a vacant lot A man with no legs came walking by And kicked the lawman in his thigh

He crashed through a wall without making a sound Into a dry creek bed and suddenly drowned A long black hearse came to cart him away But he ran for his life and is still gone today

I watched from the corner of the table The only eyewitness to facts of my fable If you doubt my lies are true Just ask the blind man, he saw it too

Using an online <a href="https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver">Vigenere Solver,</a> I was able to find that the plaintext was <code>The solution to Fake News is flag{Critical Thinking: Question EVERYTHING!}</code> with the word <code>newflash</code> used as the key.
